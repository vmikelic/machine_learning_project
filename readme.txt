Final project for machine learning class. Used the LIWC-22 text analysis tool and misinformation datasets to train models in classifying fake news.

Description of data sets
- DataSet_Misinfo_TRUE.csv
                Misinformation & Fake News text dataset 79k
                https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenpeutz/misinformation-fake-news-text-dataset-79k
- DataSet_Misinfo_FALSE.csv
                Misinformation & Fake News text dataset 79k
                https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenpeutz/misinformation-fake-news-text-dataset-79k
- 79k_Combined.csv
                Data from 'DataSet_Misinfo_TRUE.csv' and 'DataSet_Misinfo_FALSE.csv'
                were combined and preprocessed by taking out null and NaN entries
                by running 'preprocess_updated.py' on datasets.
- LIWC-22 Results - 79k_Combined LIWC Analysis.csv
                The same description as '79k_Combined.csv' except
                topic modeling was performed on the dataset and LIWC terms were
                added as additional attributes.
- 79k controversy.csv
                Data created from applying the LIWC user dictionary 'Controversial Terms Lexicon'
                to our dataset.
- 79k absolutism.csv
                Data created from applying the LIWC user dictionary 'Absolutist Dictionary'
                to our dataset.

Description of columns in the data sets
- text:         original text data from articles extracted from sources such as 
                Reuters, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Redflag Newsdesk, Beitbart, Truth Broadcast Network
- label:        These are class labels that were assigned to the text data
                0 indicates that the instance was labeled as fake
                1 indicates that the instance was labeled as true

Description of scripts
preprocess_updated.py
                This will combine 'DataSet_Misinfo_TRUE.csv' and 'DataSet_Misinfo_FALSE.csv'
                and preprocess the data by taking out instances that need to be taken out
                before running classification code on the dataset.
                The output dataset is called '79k_Combined.csv'
correlation.py
                This script runs a correlation analysis on two datasets generated by LIWC user
                dictionaries. The two datasets it uses are '79k absolutism.csv' and
                '79k controversy.csv'
Fake_News_Classification.ipynb 
                This file was created on Google Colab and can be run by running each cell.
                This script takes our LIWC processed data as input. The first 3 cells are 
		specifically to make the large dataset faster to Access. After getting rid of 
		instances with NaN, machine learning tasks such as Logistic Regression, SVM, 
		Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree are ran on the dataset. Plots are created to show 
		optimization of hyperparameters for different models. K-Folds Cross Validation is 
		performed on the different models as well and the average scores from each 
		model is obtained to determine which model performs the best. The last several 
		cells implement further improvements to the Logistic regression by concatenating 
		user-defined dictionaries to our data and creating word embeddings from our 
		news story text. It then does basic parameter tuning on this newly improved 
		logistic regression classifier.
